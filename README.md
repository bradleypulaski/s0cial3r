## s0cial3r (v.2.0)
    
### Overview

S0cial3r is the newest social media platform that was designed to build a community around the popular website twitch.tv. Users can watch Twitch streams and chat in the public Twitch chat just like on the main Twitch site, but they can also share memes on their channel of choice both while the stream is live and when it is offline, and can also private message each other, fostering a community environment that keeps users engaged and interacting with each other even when their favorite streamer is offline. 

### Getting Started 

1. Choose either to browse for and view top streams without logging in, or choose "Login with Twitch" on the main page to enter your twitch credentials and unlock the full site functionality. 

2. Users can select Top Streams to pull up a list of the most popular streams, or top games for the most popular games. They can also search for games or streamers specifically by name using the search bar. Once they are logged in and watching the stream of their choice, users can post memes on the channel for all users to view. 

3. To connect with a user personally, users can navigate to the profile list and select the profile of the user they want to interact with. Then they can choose to private message the person or simply look at their profile to get to know the individual better.
